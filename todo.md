- [] week 20
  - [] Your API should have routes to register and log in
  - [] Your endpoints to Create, Update and Delete should be authenticated
  - [] Your frontend should have a registration form which POSTs to the API to create a new user.
  - [] Your frontend should have a login form to authenticate the user.
  - [] Your passwords in the database should be encrypted with bcrypt.
  - [] You should implement error handling. Your API should let the user know if something went wrong. Be as specific as possible to help the user, e.g. by validating the user input when creating a new user, and return "That email address already exists". Include correct status codes. Error messages should also be shown on the frontend.
  - [] The validation should ensure unique email addresses and/or usernames, depending on how you'd like to structure your User model.
